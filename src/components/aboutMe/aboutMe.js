          After being introduced to coding from a young age, I have always had a
          passion for it. I first started properly coding in school where I was
          taught to code in <b>Delphi</b>, a language derived from pascal. I
          really enjoyed coding but like many, I had the misconception that
          being a programmer was an “unsociable job”, so I decided to study
          branding, a good mix of design, strategy and logic.

          During this time, I started working for tech startup companies,

          , doing marketing. This is where I became passionate about
          entrepreneurship and helping startups. I decided to start my own
          company that provided startups with branding and creative assets. I
          soon, however, hit a big roadblock, I needed to create a website that
          would automate certain jobs like connecting a company with a student.
          So I took a big risk and moved from South Africa to Paris where I took
          part in a month Bootcamp at a school called{" "}

          During this very intensive month, I learnt to code in <b>C++</b> and
          realised that working in tech is what I wanted to do. After this
          course, I moved to London with the goal of doing another Bootcamp so I
          could become a web-developer. While I was settling down in London, I
          worked for a tech company,{" "}
